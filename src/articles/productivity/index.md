Writing about productivity seems to be in vouge recently. I don't particularly think about productivity much,
but I think that's because I solved it. Like lost of people with ADHD I had to figure it out early or fail at 
school. As early as 6 I remember trying and failing to get work done in the same way that my peers did. 
It took many years before I began to develop my personal system to get things done, motivate myself, and most 
importantly not burn out.

## Getting things done

Focusing was and still is a challenge. I am fortunate that my current career is something that I enjoy doing,
but there are many things that are a slog to complete. For these I try to follow the "eat the frog" rule; getting
unpleasant or draining tasks over with first. This is helpful because the rest of the day feels like a reward, but 
also because it's draining to think about tasks you don't want to do. Having unpleasant chores looming over you is
never a good thing.

With things that are enjoyable, I feel they fall into two categories: those that I could spend hours on (we'll 
call this hyperfocus), and those that I only want to spend minimal time on (call these burst tasks). 
These two types require two different tactics. 

When you have seemingly infinite energy for a task, it's best to timebox it. Don't spend more than a few hours 
on it or else you run the risk of overengineering it, Or worse, burn yourself out and loose interest in it. 
I set timers and alarms so that I don't overdo it. The hyperfocus task will still be there tomorrow.

For things that you have only a short burst for. You want to lean into it. Get as much done in the burst as you
can, then take a break. Maybe work on a hyper focus task. When you have finished your break or timebox, try to get
one or two more things done on the burst task.

## Motivation

Going to start this out with a confession: motivation is something I still don't have figured out. There are 
though, a few things that have worked in my case. I hope they prove helpful for others as well.



## Burnout (don't do it!)
