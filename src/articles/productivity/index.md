Writing about productivity seems to be in vouge recently. I don't particularly think about productivity much,
but I think that's because I solved it. Like lost of people with ADHD I had to figure it out early or fail at 
school. As early as 6 I remember trying and failing to get work done in the same way that my peers did. 
It took many years before I began to develop my personal system to get things done, motivate myself, and most 
importantly not burn out.

## Getting things done

Focusing was and still is a challenge. I am fortunate that my current career is something that I enjoy doing,
but there are many things that are a slog to complete. For these I try to follow the "eat the frog" rule; getting
unpleasant or draining tasks over with first.
