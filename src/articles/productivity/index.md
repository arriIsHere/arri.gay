Writing about productivity seems to be in vouge recently. I don't particularly think about productivity much,
but I think that's because I solved it. Like lost of people with ADHD I had to figure it out early or fail at 
school. As early as 6 I remember trying and failing to get work done in the same way that my peers did. 
It took many years before I began to develop my personal system to get things done, motivate myself, and most 
importantly not burn out.

## Getting things done

Focusing was and still is a challenge. I am fortunate that my current career is something that I enjoy doing,
but there are many things that are a slog to complete. For these I try to follow the "eat the frog" rule; getting
unpleasant or draining tasks over with first. This is helpful because the rest of the day feels like a reward, but 
also because it's draining to think about tasks you don't want to do. Having unpleasant chores looming over you is
never a good thing.

With things that are enjoyable, I feel they fall into two categories: those that I could spend hours on (we'll 
call this hyperfocus), and those that I only want to spend minimal time on (call these burst tasks). 
These two types require two different tactics. 

When you have seemingly infinite energy for a task, it's best to timebox it. Don't spend more than a few hours 
on it or else you run the risk of overengineering it, Or worse, burn yourself out and loose interest in it. 
I set timers and alarms so that I don't overdo it. The hyperfocus task will still be there tomorrow.

For things that you have only a short burst for. You want to lean into it. Get as much done in the burst then take
a break, maybe work on a hyper focus task. When you are done try to do one or two things in the burst task.
When you run out of energy, just switch back to the other thing.

## Motivation

## Burnout (don't do it!)
