I am going to talk a bit about one of my favorite games, Life is Strange. 
I already know the story, I know how it all ends but it's a game that 
means a lot to me. While this will discuss
the game, things I liked about it, things I dislike about it, it's not a game review.
rather the game is used to tell a story of how fiction can tell us things about ourselves.
## Chrysalis

In 2014 I went to Pax East, it was my first year going, 
and I was honestly not much of a gamer (still am not TBH).
I have a lot of good memories from those two days, but one event in particular 
stuck out. My friend and I attended a panel for a game made by a studio in France
that I had never heard of. The game involved a 
heavy amount of choice and having repercussions for said choices. 
"This action will have consequences".

Knowing it was primarily a interactive story rather
than a game, I decided to buy it a few days later. I quickly got through the first
two episodes and anxiously waited for the third one to come out. By the end I 
was hungry for more interactive media that told stories like Life is Strange.

The game follows Maxine Caulfield, who discovers her "time rewind" powers by saving the 
life of her childhood friend, Chloe Price. There are cataclysmic events that take 
place as a result of this: a tornado threatens to level the town, an eclipses take 
place when none should, beached wales are found along the shore, and a double moon 
appears.

The pair have a wonderful adventure together, grow closer and of course because this
is the game industry we gotta stop short of it being explicitly gay. It's nice seeing 
a friendship rekindle after so many years apart. In the end Max realizes the only way 
to save the town is to sacrifice Chloe. It's a bittersweet ending with people
continuing their lives unharmed, but Chloe is gone.

...at least, that's what I chose the first time I played.

## Out of time 

It would be years later before I fully realized why I felt things
while playing that game. I didn't understand why it was so important to me that
Max and Chloe were more than friends, I didn't understand that feeling of longing
when I played it. Why did I want to be like Max? Was there a sort of desire to 
relive highschool (no, highschool sucked)?

Those questions sat there. They sat there as I replayed the game so many times I 
lost count. I could not figure out what was making me cry every time I played it.

A prequel ("Life is Strange: Before the Storm") came out a few years later,
this time it followed Chloe, in this one I noticed there was something about Rachel
Amber that I caught on to. She had a complicated relationship with her parents, 
she was afraid to disobey them, and I could understand that, it mirrored my
relationship with my own parents.

It wasn't summer of 2020, when we were all stuck at home due to covid, that I 
finally figured things out.

## Dark room

The first few months of 2020 were a really bad time for me. I was unable to see people 
and being alone with my thoughts and body, I had a harder time distancing myself from my
dysphoria. I was drinking a lot more, and my usual apathy for living evolved into self harm. 
I eventually came to terms with who I was, but it took until october until I could even admit 
to myself that I might, possibly, be transgender. It wasn't until January that I actually called
an informed consent clinic to get started on hormones.

Hormones were a wild ride. It was lik...well, escaping a the basement of a 
deranged kidnaper during a hurricane in a POS truck driven by your mentally 
ill friend with blue hair.

## Polarized

I replayed the game a few months after beginning hormones, and about a week after 
coming out to my coworkers. The game had a different tone this time.

Instead of the storying following a wonderful fleeting moment that she must give up
because the world she lives in feels like it's working against her friend. It's a 
story of hardship continuing throughout the game, and giving up some relationships
for one that is far more valuable.

The narrative was probably not intended to be queer in nature. It was written by two 
straight cisgender men in their 40s, as is seen my some questionable dialog choices.

I replayed the game, I choose some things differently (I like Belgian
waffles a lot more now), however, gameplay generally followed a familiar path. 
When it came to the final choice, save Chloe, or Save Arcadia Bay (bay or bae), 
I chose Chloe this time. 

After finishing the game I was lying awake in bed, wondering why I would do 
that so differently, what had changed about me. I started realizing that, in
addition to helping me discover that I was more a girl than I am a boy, the 
game reacted differently to my new priorities in life.
