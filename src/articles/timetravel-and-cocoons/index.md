## Life Is Strange

Back in 2014 I went to Pax East, it was my first year going, and I was honestly
not much of a gamer back then, my friend 'A' was though. There were lots of good
memories from the two days I went but one stook out, we attended a panel for a game
made by a studio in France. It involved a heavy amount of choice and having 
repercussions for said choices. "This action," as it said, "will have consequences").

It seemed to call to me, and knowing it was primarily a interactive story rather
than a game, I decided to buy it a few days later, I quickly got through the first
two episodes and anxiously waited for the third one to come out.

The game follows Maxine Caulfield, who discovers her "rewind" powers by saving the 
life of her friend, Chloe Price. There are cataclysmic events that take place as a 
result of this: a tornado threatens to level the town, eclipses take place when none
should, beached wales are found along the shore, and a double moon appears.

The pair have a wonderful adventure together, grow closer and give us players a 
wonderful example of queerbating. It's nice seeing a friendship rekindle after so
many years apart. In the end Max realizes the only way to save the town is to sacrifice
Chloe. It's a bittersweet ending with people continuing their lives but Chloe is gone

...at least, that's what I chose the first time I played.

It would be years later before I fully realized what it awoke in me, I felt things
while playing that game, I didn't understand why it was so important to me that
Max and Chloe were more than friends, I didn't understand that feeling of longing
when I played it. Why did I want to be like Max? Was there a sort of desire to 
relive highschool (no, highschool sucked)? I wouldn't ask these questions until around 5 years later I 
would seriously ask myself these questions. 

Those questions sat there. They sat there as I replayed the game so many times I 
lost count. I could not figure out what was making me cry every time I played it.

A prequel called "Life is Strange: Before the Storm" came out a few years later,
this time it followed Chloe, in this one I noticed there was something about Rachel
Amber that I caught on to. She had a complicated relationship with her parents, 
she was afraid to disobey them, and I could understand that, it mirrored my
relationship with my own parents.

It was in the summer of 2020 when I finally went far enough the "straw that broke
the camel's back" was reading 
[Mae's coming out comic](https://www.reallifecomics.com/comic.php?comic=june-29-2020)
at the end of june. I had finally realized all these feelings, feelings I had for 
so long could easily be explained by me not being a man.

## Rewind

Recently I have replayed the game, I remembered it, but I allowed myself to choose
as if I was playing for the first time, some things were different (I like Belgian
waffles a lot more now), gameplay followed a familar path, I tried to be a good 
person in the game, and think about others as I try to do in everyday life.

When it came to the final choice, save Chloe, or Save Arcadia Bay (bay or bae), 
I chose Chloe this time. I didn't give much thought into it when I did, I went
with my gut as it were. The strange thing is, this was the way I made the other
choice the first time.

After finishing the game I was lying awake in bed, wondering why I would do 
that so differently, what had changed about me. I started realizing that, in
addition to helping me discover that I was more a girl than I am a boy, the 
game reacted differently to my new priorities in life.
