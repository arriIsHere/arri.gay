## Life Is Strange

Back in 2014 I went to Pax East, it was my first year going, and I was honestly
not much of a gamer, my friend who I went with was though. There were 
lots of good memories from those two days, but one event in particular stook out. 
We attended a panel for a game made by a studio in France, published by Square Enix. 
It involved a heavy amount of choice and having repercussions for said choices. 
"This action," as it said, "will have consequences".

It seemed to call to me, and knowing it was primarily a interactive story rather
than a game, I decided to buy it a few days later, I quickly got through the first
two episodes and anxiously waited for the third one to come out.

The game follows Maxine Caulfield, who discovers her "rewind" powers by saving the 
life of her childhood friend, Chloe Price. There are cataclysmic events that take 
place as a result of this: a tornado threatens to level the town, eclipses take 
place when none should, beached wales are found along the shore, and a double moon 
appears.

The pair have a wonderful adventure together, grow closer and of course because this
is the game industry we gotta stop short of it being explicitly gay. It's nice seeing 
a friendship rekindle after so many years apart. In the end Max realizes the only way 
to save the town is to sacrifice Chloe. It's a bittersweet ending with people
continuing their lives unharmed, but Chloe is gone.

...at least, that's what I chose the first time I played.

It would be years later before I fully realized what it awoke in me, I felt things
while playing that game, I didn't understand why it was so important to me that
Max and Chloe were more than friends, I didn't understand that feeling of longing
when I played it. Why did I want to be like Max? Was there a sort of desire to 
relive highschool (no, highschool sucked)? I wouldn't ask these questions until 
around 5 years later. 

Those questions sat there. They sat there as I replayed the game so many times I 
lost count. I could not figure out what was making me cry every time I played it.

A prequel called "Life is Strange: Before the Storm" came out a few years later,
this time it followed Chloe, in this one I noticed there was something about Rachel
Amber that I caught on to. She had a complicated relationship with her parents, 
she was afraid to disobey them, and I could understand that, it mirrored my
relationship with my own parents.

It wasn't summer of 2020, when we were all stuck at home due to covid that I 
finally figured things out. The "straw that broke the camel's back" was reading

at the end of june.
## Rewind

Recently I have replayed the game, I choose some things differently (I like Belgian
waffles a lot more now), however, gameplay generally followed a familiar path. 
When it came to the final choice, save Chloe, or Save Arcadia Bay (bay or bae), 
I chose Chloe this time. 

After finishing the game I was lying awake in bed, wondering why I would do 
that so differently, what had changed about me. I started realizing that, in
addition to helping me discover that I was more a girl than I am a boy, the 
game reacted differently to my new priorities in life.

## Alive

My choice 5 years ago to sacrifice Chloe was highly reflective of how I viewed 
myself, I was trying to kill who I really was to maintain the facade of normalcy,
to be the "responsible son" my parents thought they had. But the thing about
this is it's very hard to kill who you are, and if you leave your feelings
unhandled, it's just going to come back stronger.

Try as I might, the storm kept coming back, and when it finally hit I knew I had
to actually deal with it. Much like the pivotal choice at the end of Life Is strange
I had to choose to keep things "normal" and slowly watch my self die inside my own
body, or actually be myself even if it would destroy many relationships that I had.

As in my replay through Life Is Strange, when I was confronted by my trans identity
last year I finally made the choice that was right for me and other people be damned. 
Every day I wake up alive, because I choose Arri and Chloe over false normalcy 
and Arcadia Bay.
