Many people my age have grown up with Star Wars. Our parents loved it when they saw it in theaters and as a result it's
a cultural staple. Regardless of if you are someone who loves it or hates it, Star Wars is a cultural icon. So it stands
to reason that inevitably it would become the property of the Walt Disney Company.

One of the results of this acquisition was a surge of new content being created in the universe. Disney was putting out
new sequels, prequels, interludes and pretty much any story they could fit into the Star Wars Universe. Some of it was good, others not so good. Result was a lot of Star Wars.

I don't think disney was doing what many people seem to claim where they throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. Instead I think Disney was trying to do what happened with Marvel: create a new category of entertainment.

# The Mandalorian 
The Mandalorian is probably the best example of Disney making a great TV show in the Star Wars setting. It's good story telling makes some interesting cinematic callbacks to classic film and television. It's a good show that surprises you and keeps you interested about what is going to happen next......at least the first season, then things don't look as good.

Regardless it served its purpose as a launch title for the new "Disney Star Wars." (No we are not talking about episodes VII, VIII, and IX, lets forget those existed.) The show had good writing had rather good practical effects and acting was great. One thing about the show, it feels very derivative.
