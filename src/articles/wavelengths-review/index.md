**Spoilers**

I am (and have been for a while) a fan of the *Life Is Strange* series. I greatly enjoyed True Colors, and may do a review on it. I feel, though like there were a lot of very good aspects of story telling in the DLC that did not get as much of a chance to shine.



* Single room is one of favorite story telling aspects
* Using focal point
* single room sorta felt pandemic-y communicating with people through radio/phone
